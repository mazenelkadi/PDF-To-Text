# PDF-To-Text

The script is designed to extract text from a selected PDF file and save it as a text file, a Word document, or an Excel spreadsheet. The user selects a PDF file using a file dialog, then specifies the format and location for saving the extracted text. The script uses pdfminer to extract text from the PDF and then processes this text according to the selected output format. This tool is useful for converting PDF documents into editable text formats or for extracting content from PDFs for further analysis or processing.
